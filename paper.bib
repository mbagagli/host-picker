  abstract = {The Python libraries NumPy and SciPy are extremely powerful tools for numerical processing and analysis well suited to a large variety of applications. We developed ObsPy (http://obspy.org), a Python library for seismology intended to facilitate the development of seismological software packages and workflows, to utilize these abilities and provide a bridge for seismology into the larger scientific Python ecosystem. Scientists in many domains who wish to convert their existing tools and applications to take advantage of a platform like the one Python provides are confronted with several hurdles such as special file formats, unknown terminology, and no suitable replacement for a non-trivial piece of software. We present an approach to implement a domain-specific time series library on top of the scientific NumPy stack. In so doing, we show a realization of an abstract internal representation of time series data permitting I/O support for a diverse collection of file formats. Then we detail the integration and repurposing of well established legacy codes, enabling them to be used in modern workflows composed in Python. Finally we present a case study on how to integrate research code into ObsPy, opening it to the broader community. While the implementations presented in this work are specific to seismology, many of the described concepts and abstractions are directly applicable to other sciences, especially to those with an emphasis on time series analysis.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for automatic P-phase arrival time determination for local and regional seismic events based on higher order statistics (HOS). Using skewness or kurtosis a characteristic function is determined to which a new iterative picking algorithm is applied. For P-phase identification we apply the Akaike Information Criterion to the characteristic function, while for a precise determination of the P-phase arrival time a pragmatic picking algorithm is applied to a recalculated characteristic function. In addition, an automatic quality estimate is obtained, based on the slope and the signal-to-noise ratio, both calculated from the characteristic function. To get rid of erroneous picks, a Jackknife procedure and an envelope function analysis is used. The algorithm is applied to a large data set with very heterogeneous qualities of P-onsets acquired by a temporary, regional seismic network of the EGELADOSproject in the southern Aegean. The reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm is tested by comparing more than 3000 manually derived P readings, serving as reference picks, with the corresponding automatically estimated P-wave arrival times. We find an average deviation from the reference picks of 0.26 {$\pm$} 0.64 s when using kurtosis and 0.38 {$\pm$} 0.75 s when using skewness. If automatically as excellent classified picks are considered only, the average difference from the reference picks is 0.07 {$\pm$} 0.31 s and 0.07 {$\pm$} 0.41 s, respectively. However, substantially more P-arrival times are determined when using kurtosis, indicating that the characteristic function derived from kurtosis estimation is to be preferred. Since the characteristic function is calculated recursively, the algorithm is very fast and hence suited for earthquake early warning purposes. Furthermore, a comparative study with automatically derived P-readings using Allen's and Baer \& Kradolfer's picking algorithms applied to the same data set demonstrates better quantitative and qualitative performance of the HOS approach. This study shows, that precise automatic P-onset determination is feasible, even when using data sets with very heterogeneous signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {The automatic and accurate phase arrival identification is a fundamental problem for seismologists worldwide. Several approaches have been reported in the literature, but most of them only selectively deal with the problem and are severely affected by noise presence. In this paper, a new approach based on higher-order statistics (HOS) is introduced that overcomes the subjectivity of human intervention and eliminates the noise factor. By using skewness and kurtosis, two algorithms have been formed, namely, Phase Arrival Identification\textendash Skewness/Kurtosis (PAI\textendash S/K), and some advantages have been gained over the usual approaches, resulting in the automatic identification of the transition from Gaussianity to non-Gaussianity that coincides with the onset of the seismic event, despite noise presence. Experimental results on real seismic data, gathered by the Seismological Network of the Department of Geophysics of Aristotle University, demonstrate an excellent performance of the PAI\textendash S/K scheme, regarding both accuracy and noise robustness. The simplicity of the proposed method makes it an attractive candidate for huge seismic data assessment in a real-time context.},
