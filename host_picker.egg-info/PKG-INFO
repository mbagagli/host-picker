Description: # HOST
        
        **Author:** _Matteo Bagagli_
        **Date:** _10/2021_
        **Version:** _2.3.1_
        
        ## What is it?
        The **HOST** acronym stands for **H**igh-**O**rder-**ST**atistics seismic pickers.
        This algorithm took inspiration from the one described in [_Baillard et al. 2014_](10.1785/0120120347).
        The idea behing this package is to provide user-friendly classes for seismic phase picking with
        _skewness_ and _kurtosis_ carachteristic-functions.
        Originally applied to seismograms by [_Saragiotis et al._](10.1109/TGRS.2002.800438),
        the HOS-CF are able to detect energic transient when the statistical properties of a seismogram
        (or time series) change abruptly. These CF are calculated on moving window with fixed window.
        
        Measurements of statistical properties in a moving window are suitable for frequency-specific
        (or expected) transient. For this reason, the picker support a multi-window analysis,
        in order to collect more information or even increase the quality of detections.
        Both _skewness_ and _kurtosis_ are calculated with C-routine under the hood,
        making this package fast and suitable also for realtime picking porpouses.
        
        
        ## Standard installation
        In general, the usage of virtual env is a good habit for python users.
        Although this package's dependencies is not For separated **conda** environment is recommended.
        Since version `v2.3.1` the picker can be found in PyPI repository. Therefore to install the latest
        stable version you may simply type:
        ```bash
        $ pip install host
        ```
        and be ready to go.
        
        ## Developer installation
        If you want to be updated with the latest patches or even contribute to
        the project (yes, really your PR are welcome!), fork-me and clone it
        to your device:
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/mbagagli/host host
        $ cd host/
        $ # conda activate myenv (optional)
        $ pip install .
        ```
        ... et voila'!
        
        ## Additional infos
        Although the package testing is in [Travis-CI](), you could still install `pytest` and
        inside the cloned folder type:
        ```bash
        $ pytest
        ```
        to check everything is fine
        
        The package comes with jupyter-notebooks (under `books` subdir) where you
        can test and understand this picking-algorithm.
